# Pale Moon SnR (Save and Restore)

Currently this does not do much, in fact it does not do even backup profiles at the moment.

What is currently on the list:
 - Actually backup selected profile(s).
 - Detect .lock files and warn user.
 - Allow program to be daemonized to auto-sync profile.
 - Allow encrypted backups.
